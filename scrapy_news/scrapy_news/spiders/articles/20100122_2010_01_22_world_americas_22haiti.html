 <p>Here in one of the cities hardest hit by the earthquake &#151; as in Port-au-Prince, the capital &#151; the housing needs are acute, and demand for shelter has intensified. Officials with the Haitian government and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100124104209/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about the United Nations.">United Nations</a> said Thursday that they were moving as quickly as possible to establish organized camps, with water, food and health care, before the rainy season starts to peak in May. </p><p>&#8220;A lot of these people have maybe a sheet on four sticks over their heads right now,&#8221; said Niurka Pi&#241;eiro, a spokeswoman for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100124104209/http://www.iom.int/jahia/jsp/index.jsp" title="Organizations Web site">International Organization for Migration</a>. &#8220;It&#8217;s really urgent that we get these tents so we can provide a little better cover from the elements.&#8221; </p><p>Haitian and international officials, aware that these camps may become permanent, are hotly debating locations. In Phase 2 of the plan, private companies would be contracted to build apartment complexes and homes with the help of residents living in the tents. </p><p>&#8220;We are hoping that this concentration of people will lead to work,&#8221; said Patrick Delatour, the minister of tourism, after a meeting with President <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100124104209/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/rene_preval/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Rene Preval">Ren&#233; Pr&#233;val</a>. &#8220;They will help build their own housing.&#8221;</p><p>Officials with the migration agency have argued for sites inside cities close to employment, while Haitian government ministers have stressed the need to build as much shelter as fast as possible. </p><p>Already, work has begun on government land near the suburb of Croix des Bouquets. United Nations troops from Brazil have begun leveling the ground in preparation for a tent city for around 30,000 people. Officials hope to house 100,000 people with the dozen or so sites selected so far, which include the lawn of the prime minister&#8217;s office, but getting the tents to Haiti remains a difficult challenge. </p><p>A handful arrived Wednesday, and a larger shipment from Turkey and other countries came Thursday, but Ms. Pi&#241;eiro said thousands more would be needed. &#8220;We are really looking for family-sized tents,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But at this point, we&#8217;ll take anything.&#8221;</p><p>Here on the southern coast in Jacmel, the country&#8217;s fourth-largest city, where it has rained several times since the earthquake last week, every drop from the sky brings another round of fear. </p><p>Whole sections of the once vibrant downtown, about 25 miles southwest of Port-au-Prince, were flattened in the earthquake. Most of the city&#8217;s 40,000 residents are now homeless. While they say they need food, water and medicine, when asked for their top priority, they shout &#8220;tent, tent.&#8221; Nothing is lost in translation because the Creole word is the same as the English one.</p><p>Patricia Legros is living in a bus-long shamble of blue tarps and shower curtains with an American flag for a door. She lives with her parents, a brother, cousins, neighbors. There is an artist, a taxi driver, a police officer, a tailor &#151; 30 people in all. They sleep side by side on mattresses pulled from the rubble. Each night three of the men stand guard by firelight to keep cars from running them down.</p><p>Charles Mary Ren&#233;, 22, who has been living on a blanket in Toussaint Louverture Square here since the earthquake with her 3-year-old son and his father, Eddy Leonard, said that during the few times it rained, they just sat and got soaked. &#8220;What could we do, we have nowhere to go,&#8221; she said.</p><p>Each night before they go to bed, like people everywhere in Haiti left homeless by the earthquake, they pray for some miracle before the rainy season sends water flooding in.</p><p>The answer for now is tents &#151; and there are not nearly enough. </p><p>An aid group, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100124104209/http://plan-international.org/" title="Groups Web site">Plan International</a>, handed out 400 tents in Jacmel on Tuesday and planned to provide 300 more on Wednesday to people on a list provided by a local official. But when the group showed up at a homeless camp, hundreds rushed the vehicles carrying the tents, desperate for shelter, illustrating the difficulty of delivering aid. </p><p> &#8220;They had to leave without giving out a single one,&#8221; said Benjamin Legoff, a French firefighter who was coordinating a medical clinic in the camp. </p><p>&#8220;Organization is the most important thing,&#8221; he added. &#8220;The means without organization is nothing.&#8221; </p><p>Robin Costello, a spokeswoman for the group, said the reason the group left was &#8220;to make sure nobody got hurt.&#8221; </p><p> But for the people of Jacmel, it was another sign that the aid supply failed to match demand.</p><p> In Port-au-Prince, the frantic need for shelter is just as strong. Estimates from the United Nations suggest that every other building in the capital has collapsed. With frequent aftershocks rattling the city, almost all of Port-au-Prince&#8217;s roughly four million residents, including temporary residents,  seem to be sleeping under the stars.</p><div id="pageLinks"><ul id="pageNumbers"><li> 1 </li><li> <a onclick="s_code_linktrack('Article-MultiPagePageNum2');" title="Page 2" href="/web/20100124104209/http://www.nytimes.com:80/2010/01/22/world/americas/22haiti.html?pagewanted=2&amp;hp">2</a> </li></ul><a class="next" onclick="s_code_linktrack('Article-MultiPage-Next');" title="Next Page" href="/web/20100124104209/http://www.nytimes.com:80/2010/01/22/world/americas/22haiti.html?pagewanted=2&amp;hp">Next Page &#x00bb;</a></div><nyt_author_id><div id="authorId"><p>Damien Cave reported from Port-au-Prince and Ray Rivera from Jacmel, Haiti.
