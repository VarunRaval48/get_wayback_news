The pledges include 6 million pounds from Britain, 3 million euros from Spain, 3 million euros from the European Commission, 2 million euros from the Netherlands and 1.5 million euros from Germany. </p><p>Brussels has sent a team of experts to assess the situation in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121060525/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/haiti/index.html?inline=nyt-geo" title="More news and information about Haiti.">Haiti</a>, while a number of governments have joined the search-and-rescue effort, sending  in searchers and sniffer dogs. </p><p>On Monday, European development ministers will hold an emergency meeting in Brussels to consider how to start reconstruction once humanitarian aid has reached Haiti. </p><p>&#8220;It is important to tell the people of Haiti that we stand ready to help them as much as we can in this tragedy,&#8221; Ms. Ashton said Thursday. &#8220;They can count on Europe.&#8221; </p><p>Her new job was created by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121060525/http://www.nytimes.com/info/treaty-of-lisbon/?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about the Treaty of Lisbon.">Lisbon Treaty</a>, which entered into force  late last year. </p><p>Ms. Ashton&#8217;s appointment has not yet formally been approved by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121060525/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_parliament/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about European Parliament">European Parliament</a> and she has yet to build her own diplomatic corps, one of the chief responsibilities of the job.

France has a large community of Haitians, estimated at 50,000 or more, and is also host to numerous Haitian exiled political figures and intellectuals. </p><p>Christine Lagarde, the French economy minister, said on Friday that she had asked members of the Paris Club, a grouping of creditor nations, to speed debt relief for the country. </p><p>The Paris Club agreed in July to clear Haiti&#8217;s $62.7 million in debt under the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121060525/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/international_monetary_fund/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about the International Monetary Fund.">International Monetary Fund</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121060525/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_bank/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about World Bank">World Bank</a>&#8217;s initiative for heavily indebted poor countries.

It is sending supplies to set up a 100-bed hospital with a surgical unit. </p><p>The Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross said Friday that one of its teams &#151; comprising 11 emergency experts &#151; had arrived in Port-au-Prince, while a cargo plane carrying 40 tons of medical supplies was in the air and expected to reach the area late Friday. </p><p>On Friday, Red Cross workers in Port-au-Prince distributed medical assistance to five major hospitals and clinics, as well as to smaller facilities set up by local doctors in areas with a high concentration of earthquake survivors. </p><p> In Britain, the actor John Hurt led a joint appeal by the Disasters Emergency Committee, which brings together a number of aid agencies, asking the public for help. </p><p> &#8220;It is clear after the immediate rescue attempt is completed we will be left with ongoing humanitarian challenges,&#8221; said the committee&#8217;s chief, Brendan Gormley. </p><p> Britons have donated more than 2 million pounds to the appeal in 36 hours, according to the committee. </p><p> A number of companies in Europe have also pledged assistance. </p><p> E.D.F., the French electricity giant, said that it was ready to send technicians to Haiti from the neighboring French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe to help assess the damage to the electricity network. The company said that it was also prepared to send in teams to help provide emergency power to help the rescue and medical efforts. </p><p>The company has been working with the non-profit group Electriciens sans Fronti&#232;res. </p><p>The Irish telecommunications company Digicel said it would donate $5 million and help repair the phone network, the Associated Press said. </p><nyt_author_id><div id="authorId"><p> Stephen Castle contributed reporting from Brussels.</p></div></nyt_author_id><nyt_update_bottom>
