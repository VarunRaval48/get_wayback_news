    <p>LONDON &#151; As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100107032737/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Barack Obama.">President Obama</a> and his national security team met at the White House to review the attempted Christmas Day bombing of an American trans-Atlantic airliner, the British government moved Tuesday to reduce strains between London and Washington over intelligence lapses in the case of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100107032737/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/umar_farouk_abdulmutallab/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab.">Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab</a>, the suspect in the failed  attack.</p>      <p>Appearing before the House of Commons, the home secretary, Alan Johnson, retracted an assertion made on Monday by a spokesman for Prime Minister <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100107032737/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/gordon_brown/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Gordon Brown.">Gordon Brown</a> that implied that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100107032737/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/unitedkingdom/index.html?inline=nyt-geo" title="More news and information about United Kingdom.">Britain</a> had passed intelligence information about Mr. Abdulmutallab to the United States that might have helped avert the attack.</p><p>&#8220;I would like to clarify that no information was held by the U.K. or shared by the U.K. with the U.S. that indicated that Abdulmutallab was about to attempt a terrorism attack against the U.S.,&#8221; Mr. Johnson said.</p><p>British officials said Mr. Johnson&#8217;s statement followed a week of behind-the-scenes strains over the Dec. 25 attack on a Northwest Airlines plane descending into Detroit. These officials, speaking anonymously because they work regularly with the Americans, said American officials were &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221; with the fact that Britain&#8217;s intelligence agencies had information about Mr. Abdulmutallab&#8217;s contacts with Islamic extremists during<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100107032737/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/world/europe/30nigerian.html" title="Times article"> his three years as an engineering student in London</a> that had not been passed to American agencies before the airliner attack.</p><p>British security officials have been quoted in several British newspapers as saying that Mr. Abdulmutallab, a 23-year-old Nigerian, had been known to British intelligence officials during his years at University College London, from 2005 to 2008, as having had contacts with Islamic extremists in London. But the officials have said that he  was one among many people who had such contacts, and that British counterterrorism analysts had not detected anything that suggested that Mr. Abdulmutallab himself had become a security threat.</p><p>For that reason, these officials have said, there were no grounds for placing Mr. Abdulmutallab on Britain&#8217;s terrorist watch list. When Mr. Abdulmutallab was refused a new student visa to enter Britain in May 2009, the officials have said, the rejection was because his bid involved a &#8220;bogus college&#8221; of a kind often used by migrants seeking to evade Britain&#8217;s border controls by posing falsely as students, not because he was regarded as a terrorist threat.</p><p>Since the 9/11 attacks, intelligence cooperation between the United States and Britain on terrorist matters has frequently been strained because of American concerns that British counterterrorism agencies have been reluctant to accept the extent to which Britain&#8217;s network of Islamic extremists &#151; and, on occasion, a British slowness in disrupting extremist activities and arresting those involved &#151; poses a security threat beyond Britain&#8217;s borders, particularly to the United States.</p><p> Against this background, and in the wake of the failed attack on the plane bound for Detroit, Mr. Brown and other senior officials have issued a series of statements in recent days that have emphasized the importance to Britain of close intelligence cooperation with the United States. While defending their actions in the case of Mr. Abdulmutallab, the British officials have acknowledged, as Mr. Brown said   in a statement on Friday, the need for Britain to be &#8220;ever more vigilant about maximizing our protection against those who we believe pose a threat.&#8221;</p><p>The Brown statement suggested the pressure that British officials have felt over the Abdulmutallab case. It noted Britain&#8217;s action in refusing Mr. Abdulmutallab a new student visa in 2009, and emphasized  Britain&#8217;s actions in building a watch list of potential terrorists and its action in barring 180 individuals from entering  Britain because of terrorist links. </p><p>Notably, it suggested that Mr. Abdulmutallab&#8217;s reported turn to violence had occurred after he left Britain. &#8220;We are increasingly clear that he linked up with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100107032737/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/al_qaeda/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Al Qaeda.">Al Qaeda</a> in Yemen after leaving London,&#8221; the prime minister said.</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Brown&#8217;s spokesman, Simon Lewis, appeared to go a step further. He told reporters that &#8220;security information&#8221; about Mr. Abdulmutallab&#8217;s activities in London had been &#8220;shared with U.S. authorities.&#8221; But after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100107032737/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/6938334/Pressure-on-Barack-Obama-to-reveal-what-Britain-said-about-Detroit-bomber.html" title="Daily Telegraph article">The Daily Telegraph</a> posted an online report on Tuesday quoting White House officials as saying that no such information had been passed before the Dec. 25 attack, Mr. Lewis backtracked, saying the information he cited was a &#8220;routine exchange of information,&#8221; not a specific warning that Mr. Abdulmutallab posed a terrorist threat.</p><p>Mr. Lewis also refused to say whether the information had been given to American officials before or after the attack. &#8220;There is absolutely no suggestion that the U.K. passed on any information to the U.S. which they did not act on,&#8221; he said. Within hours, Mr. Johnson, the home secretary, whose responsibilities include MI5, appeared in the House of Commons to repeat the message, apparently to assuage unease in Washington about Mr. Lewis&#8217;s statement on Monday.</p><nyt_update_bottom>
