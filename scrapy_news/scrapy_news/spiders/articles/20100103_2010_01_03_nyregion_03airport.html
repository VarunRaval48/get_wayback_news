 <p>ON the day before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100106071330/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/t/thanksgiving_day/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about Thanksgiving.">Thanksgiving</a> &#151; one of the year&#8217;s most exasperating days for air travelers &#151; jet planes were soaring out of Long Island MacArthur Airport on time. There were no lines at the check-in counters, no lines to clear security and no lineup of idling planes on the runway.</p><p>Cindy Poll, 47, a nurse who was on her way to spend Thanksgiving with her brother  near  Columbus, Ohio, chose MacArthur even though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100106071330/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/l/la_guardia_airport_nyc/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about LaGuardia Airport.">La Guardia</a> and Kennedy Airports are about as close to her Syosset home, and even though using MacArthur would mean a detour through Baltimore.</p><p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t feel like dealing with the lines and dealing with the traffic &#151; I didn&#8217;t feel like dealing with Queens,&#8221; said Ms. Poll, as if Queens embodied all that was wrong with air travel.</p><p> Ms. Poll is just the kind of flier MacArthur is looking for these days. The airport, eager to sell itself to Long Island&#8217;s three million people as a laid-back, less crowded alternative to the congestion at Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Liberty Airports, is plastering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100106071330/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/l/long_island_rail_road/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Long Island Rail Road.">Long Island Rail Road</a> trains and stations with posters, and showing ads at multiplexes. The airport&#8217;s slogan: &#8220;We Make Flying a Breeze.&#8221; </p><p>That initiative, which may gain appeal as air travel gets generally more frustrating after the Dec. 25 bombing attempt, is just one way some of the region&#8217;s local airports &#151; MacArthur, Atlantic City International Airport and Stewart International Airport outside Newburgh, N.Y. &#151; are seeking to promote growth. Not all the regional airports are pushing expansion and some are forbidden from doing so, but many are adding new flights and, with them, new advertising campaigns. Perhaps most important, regional airport officials hope that as the economy rebounds they will look more and more attractive to time-pressed passengers and airlines, too. </p><p> &#8220;When the economy snaps back and congestion increases at the three major airports, that might act as an impetus for carriers to use the regionals,&#8221; said Steve Van Beek, president of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100106071330/http://www.enotrans.com/" title="Web site.">Eno Transportation Foundation</a>, a nonprofit research group. </p><p>MacArthur, which has 56 flights a day to Philadelphia, Baltimore, Chicago, Las Vegas and several Florida destinations, is planning to add, in June, a morning flight by US Airways to Washington and an evening flight back &#151; a route the airline dropped after 9/11. </p><p>After losing some flights in the Delta Airlines bankruptcy, Atlantic City has also started some new routes: to Boston on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100106071330/http://www.spiritair.com/" title="Web site.">Spirit Airlines</a>, to Atlanta on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100106071330/http://www.airtran.com/Home.aspx" title="Web site.">AirTran Airways</a> and to Toronto on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100106071330/http://www.westjet.com/" title="Web site.">WestJet</a>. Much of this expansion was driven by the casino industry, which is relying more on air traffic for customers as rival casinos in Connecticut and New York lure away gamblers who drive, said Bart R. Mueller, executive director of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100106071330/http://www.acairport.com/sjta/annual_report.asp" title="Web site.">South Jersey Transportation Authority</a>. The authority runs the airport.</p><p> Also, the Atlantic City airport will soon break ground for a new international arrivals center with customs inspections, and three new gates. That expansion, to be finished in 2011, will give more weight to the &#8220;international&#8221; in the airport&#8217;s name. </p><p>Meanwhile, in Orange County, Stewart International Airport, a former military base, is benefiting from a $500 million, 10-year refurbishing project by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100106071330/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/p/port_authority_of_new_york_and_new_jersey/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about the Port Authority of New York And New Jersey.">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a>, its owner since 2007. Stewart was thought of in the 1970s as a fourth major airport, but that role proved elusive; now, with 10 flights a day to Detroit, Florida and Philadelphia, the Port Authority sees Stewart primarily as a provincial airport for mid-Hudson Valley residents. </p><p>But Stewart has ambitions. It has been buying billboard space and local chambers of commerce are running radio ads encouraging people to &#8220;fly local.&#8221; Stewart plans to build a new customs station and a new cargo transfer station, and to upgrade its electrical and sanitation systems.</p><p> &#8220;We&#8217;re fully committed to Stewart and working with local chambers of commerce and citizens in that part of the world to get them thinking about Stewart,&#8221; said John P. Kelly, an airport spokesman. </p><p>Beyond the ad campaigns and construction plans, regional airports are also hoping the recession will end.</p><p>Jeffrey M. Zupan, a senior fellow at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100106071330/http://www.rpa.org/" title="Web site.">Regional Plan Association</a>, said passenger traffic at La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark had dropped to 102 million this year from 109 million in 2007. As the economy picks up, the industry expects much of that traffic to return. In this, the regional airports see opportunity, since it will bring crowding and delay to the major airports. The regional airports are typically less congested. For the year that ended Sept. 30, for example, 83 percent of flights to MacArthur arrived on time, compared with 68 percent of flights to La Guardia and 72 percent at Kennedy.</p><p>Not every regional airport plans to grow. Westchester County Airport, which has 58 daily flights to Atlanta, Chicago, Toronto and Washington, is already operating at or close to the peak levels allowed by a 25-year-old county law that protects people who live nearby from the drone of aircraft. The restrictions limit commercial flights to four per half-hour and the number of passengers to 240 per half-hour. </p><p>Might that law be relaxed? &#8220;The chances of that happening are just about as great as my getting struck by lightning and hitting the lottery on the same day,&#8221; said Lawrence C. Salley, the county transportation commissioner.</p><p>But at MacArthur, which is owned by the town of Islip, local resistance to airport noise has softened a bit because &#8220;the airline industry has met that challenge with much quieter planes,&#8221; said Phil Nolan, the town supervisor.</p><p> The recession has made economic growth particularly desirable, a fact that strengthens the cause of airport expansion. In Islip, officials like Teresa Rizzuto, MacArthur&#8217;s manager, point out that the airport has contributed to the investment of more than $184 million along the airport corridor and the creation of more than 1,600 jobs there. Moreover, they add, any expansion will be aided by the pre-recession boom; since 2004, 164 new buildings totaling 7.3 million square feet were constructed within three miles of the airport, including four hotels. </p><p>Still, the regional airports have limits. Local residents may like quieter planes, but they may oppose busier airports because of the resulting traffic congestion. And the airlines are cautious about starting new routes at regional airports, fearing that they will be competing with their own flights. </p><p>Asked why US Airways does not put more planes at the smaller regional airports, Valerie Wunder, a spokeswoman, said, &#8220;We put our planes where the demand is.&#8221; </p><p> Further, Mr. Van Beek said, airlines prefer airports where there are abundant connections, and where they have enough flights to pay for maintaining a full-time staff.</p><p> But Ms. Rizzuto predicted that carriers&#8217; attitudes would change as passenger demand heats up. </p><p>&#8220;Air congestion is atrocious,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and a lot of airlines are looking for reliever airports.&#8221; </p><nyt_update_bottom>
