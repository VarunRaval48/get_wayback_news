    <p>As a limited number of relief flights landed at Port-au-Prince airport on Friday, international assistance agencies struggled to find alternative routes for aid in the face of survivors&#8217; angry criticism that no help was getting through.</p>

 <p>Officials at international aid organizations in Geneva and Rome said in telephone interviews that supplies had begun to arrive via Santo Domingo in the neighboring Dominican Republic, and that vessels with built-in ramps capable of delivering supplies to the badly damaged port in the Haitian capital were being organized. </p><p>The logistical challenges in and around the capital &#151; damaged roads, little fuel &#151; were daunting, but there were small signs of progress, the organizations said. </p><p>Organizations distributed tarps and other materials to 4,000 people without shelter on Thursday, and 8,000 more people were expected to receive similar assistance Friday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100119230605/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/ban_ki_moon/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Ban Ki-moon.">Ban Ki-moon</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100119230605/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about the United Nations.">United Nations</a> secretary-general, said the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100119230605/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_food_program/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about the World Food Program">World Food Program</a> was feeding about 8,000 people several times a day, with high-energy biscuits and ready-to-eat meals. The mass devastation, however, dwarfed the effort. </p><p> &#8220;It is still a drop in the bucket,&#8221; said Elisabeth Byrs, a spokeswoman for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Geneva. &#8220;But step by step, it will increase.&#8221;</p><p>Confusion and chaos on the ground was mirrored in the air, with private aircraft clogging the airspace above Port-au-Prince&#8217;s airport, blocking some humanitarian fights from landing. By Friday afternoon, the Federal Aviation Administration, which has been coordinating air traffic control at the Port-au-Prince airport, issued a stern warning: no planes bound from the United States, military or civilian, would be allowed to land without express permission from the agency. </p><p>Exceptions would be granted only to humanitarian planes, based on arrival times and on the availability of space at the airport, a notice from the agency said. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100119230605/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/f/federal_aviation_administration/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.">F.A.A.</a> warned pilots that fuel still was not available at the airport, and any aircraft bound there would need to have enough fuel to circle the airport for at least an hour.</p><p>The move may ease some of the deadlock that has been preventing relief from getting through. The World Food Program, for example, had been attempting to land a plane filled with food supplies to shore up existing stocks in the city, but as of Friday afternoon, it had not succeeded. The agency estimates that 2 million people are in need, said Greg Barrow, a spokesman. </p><p>On the ground, the deteriorating conditions were underlined by reports of looting, including at warehouses stocked with the remaining 6,000 tons of the World Food Program&#8217;s provisions in Port-au-Prince, Mr. Barrow said. The food relief agency, which says looting is not unusual in such crises, reported that it had recovered most of the food.</p><p>Emilia Casella, a spokeswoman with the agency, which is based in Rome, noted that regular food stores in the capital &#8220;have been cleaned out&#8221; by desperate Haitians, a report by The Associated Press said. </p><p>Ms. Byrs of the United Nations said relief agencies had started to shuttle staff and supplies by road, small plane and helicopter to bring in personnel from Santo Domingo, but that the arrangements remained irregular. She said that she believed survivors could still be found.</p><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s still hope; that&#8217;s the important thing,&#8221; she said. </p><p> Mobile operating theaters and more surgical specialists were en route, but were delayed in the air and on the roads from the Dominican Republic. </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100119230605/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/d/doctors_without_borders/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Doctors Without Borders">Doctors Without Borders</a> said it had landed two cargo planes directly into Toussaint Louverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince, but others have had to go through Santo Domingo. </p><p>To the extent that Toussaint Louverture airport was able to function, it was thanks largely to the two air traffic controllers from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100119230605/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/us_air_force/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about U.S. Air Force">United States Air Force</a> who had taken over the damaged tower and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100119230605/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/us_army/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about the United States Army.">United States Army</a> soldiers who were directing ground operations.</p><p>Just about every route for relief supplies seemed to have problems. Mr. Barrow, the spokesman for the World Food Program, which is heading up logistical operations, said that on the narrow road from Santo Domingo, vehicles took 12 to 18 hours to reach Port-au-Prince. With unloading equipment damaged at the capital&#8217;s port, he said, the World Food Program was planning to charter vessels with ramps &#151; which can unload without cranes &#151; to bring in food. But sailing time for such vessels from the nearest point in the United States was three days. </p><p> &#8220;Realistically, for us to bring in food, the priority is by sea,&#8221; he said.</p><p>Once aid arrives at the airport, it will face additional logistical challenges. There was only one warehouse to hold the expected influx of materials and no clear plan of how to distribute supplies from the airport to the city.</p><p>DHL, the international shipping company, said 14 of its employees were on the ground to help manage arriving air freight in order to prevent bottlenecks at the airport. The team will assist in the distribution of these goods once roads are stable, working with the Red Cross, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100119230605/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations_childrens_fund/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about United Nations Children's Fund">UNICEF</a> and World Food Program, it said. </p><p>Commercial air service to Port au Prince is suspended until at least Sunday, the F.A.A. said.</p><p>For many organizations, the work in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100119230605/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/haiti/index.html?inline=nyt-geo" title="More news and information about Haiti.">Haiti</a> has been transformed into exploring every route to bring in relief supplies and to expect the unexpected when earlier plans fall part. </p><p>Catholic Relief Services, for example, plans to ship water and food rations for 500 families over the road from Santo Domingo on Saturday, but reports of looting near the Haitian border have made their drivers nervous. So now, they are trying to get a United States military escort for the convoy once it crosses into Haiti. </p><p>A boat with thousands of metric tons of vegetable oil and soy-fortified bulgur wheat that has been en route for weeks is also due to arrive Saturday at Port-au-Prince. After a day of negotiations, it now looks like the ship will be rerouted to a functioning port, Les Cayes, in the south. </p><p>Staff members, meanwhile, continue to arrive at the Port-au-Prince airport when they can manage it. </p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about work-arounds,&#8221; said Schuyler Thorup, the director of Latin American operations for the organization. &#8220;There are tremendous challenges.&#8221;</p><nyt_author_id><div id="authorId"><p>Alan Cowell reported from Paris, and Sharon Otterman from New York.
