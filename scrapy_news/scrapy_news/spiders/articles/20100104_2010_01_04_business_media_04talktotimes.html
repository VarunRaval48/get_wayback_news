 <p>Ms. Warren is responsible for advertising sales for The New York Times newspaper and magazines, for NYTimes.com, and for The International Herald Tribune. For the last 13 months, since she was named the Web sites general manager, she has led the business operations of NYTimes.com. As chief advertising officer, a position she has held since June 2005, she has overseen the integration of advertising between The Times on the Web and the paper.</p><p>Ms. Warren has spent more than 20 years with the Times Company in leadership roles covering both traditional and emerging mediums, including newspapers, magazines, online, mobile and social networking platforms. She is serving as president of New York Women in Communications for 2009-2010. A graduate of Tulane University who earned an M.B.A. in communications and media management from Fordham University in 1992, Ms. Warren is a certified public accountant.</p><p>She lives in Long Island, N.Y. with her husband, two daughters and their dog, Jeter.</p><p><span class="bold">Charging Online Readers</span></p><p><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Q. </span> Do you think that The New York Times can survive in the medium and long term relying only, or mostly, on online advertising revenue? Are there plans for a paid version of the online paper, which would allow those who wish to pay for the privilege of reading to do so?</span></p><p><div align="right"><span class="italic"> &#151; Dan Heller, Sunnyvale, Calif.</span></div></p><p><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Q. </span> I read The Times daily &#151; but only on the Internet, for several reasons.  Delivery of the paper edition to my German address would be too slow.  The cost of a paper subscription is prohibitive.  I am only interested in a small percentage of the articles in any single print edition.  Some of the Internet articles are not in the print edition.  Yet, I consider the economic viability of The Times to be in my interest, and I would be willing to pay something for access to your Internet content. So I ask you, how can an Internet user of The Times support your company in a fair way, commensurate to his or her usage?</span></p><p><div align="right"><span class="italic"> &#151; Scott Stock Gissendanner, Goettingen, Germany</span></div></p><p><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Q. </span> Why doesn't The Times charge online readers for a yearly subscription fee, the way the Journal does? Does this affect advertising revenue? I'd much rather pay a one-time fee than the current system we have now. </span></p><p><div align="right"><span class="italic"> &#151; Jeof, Astoria, N.Y.</span></div></p><p><span class="bold">A. </span> I've chosen to make questions about charging for content the first ones I answer, as they are posed to us in one form or another nearly every day.</p><p> This is an issue we have been carefully exploring over the past year. While we have nothing new to say about our efforts in this arena right now, it is worth repeating what my colleague Martin Nisenholtz said when he was asked the same question: </p><p><blockquote>Today, we continue to carefully analyze the question of how paid content can augment our core advertising business. The trick, of course, is to garner incremental revenue from the user without significantly cannibalizing the high rate ad pages that now account for a very significant amount of money. Unlike many local news Web sites that still depend mostly on declining classified ad revenues, NYTimes.com has a very large national display revenue stream. As we develop new pay-for-content ideas, we must carefully balance our ability to generate meaningful dollars from both sources.</blockquote></p><p><span class="bold">Annoyed by Ad Policy</span></p><p><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Q. </span> I find a couple aspects of The Times's online advertising policy to be highly
annoying &#151; mainly the arrival of ever larger full-page ads that cover up the content I'm trying to read, and the increasing use of intrusive video advertisements, which can really cripple an old computer like mine. </span></p><p><span class="italic"> But I've always wondered if another aspect of the Web site that I find annoying is related to ad revenue.  I'm referring to the frequent division of an article's text across several "pages."  If a particular article exceeds a certain length, I'll often be required to click through several pages to see the whole story (though of course there is a link with the "single page" option).  But this is the Internet, and there are no real page limits.</span></p><p><span class="italic">Clicking through several pages to read a single story is a huge annoyance, and I've always assumed it was solely a ploy to inflate page views.  Is my assumption correct?</span></p><p><div align="right"><span class="italic"> &#151; Paul</span></div></p><p><span class="bold">A. </span> Paul, Thanks for your question. Let me first address your comments regarding our online advertising policies.</p><p>We take great care to ensure that we balance the user experience against the need to produce advertising revenue to support our journalistic mission. The large-format advertisements you refer to command a significant premium, and drive a very sizable amount of revenue.  This revenue allows us to invest in the types of journalism, multimedia experiences, and technological innovation that our readers have come to expect from NYTimes.com. We think that this results in a fair balance for the reader, and is one that we carefully monitor every day. </p><p>We do have specific limitations on the number and type of these ads that a user will encounter. For instance, we limit the number of home page high-impact ad units in a given month, and serve a maximum of one "interstitial" ad unit (large ads displayed in between content pages) to a given user in a given day. In addition, we ensure that these ads always contain a "skip this ad" button.</p><p>Now, let me address your question about pagination.</p><p>In the early days of the Web site, we paginated &#151; as you rightly point out &#151; to increase the inventory of advertising opportunities we could sell to advertisers. Now, our audience has grown dramatically since those early days, and we are no longer in that position. The question really has more to do now with cracking the code on the best way to present long-form journalism, and with the difficulty of changing our page templates. We will consider improving this experience, as we seek to improve the way we present our high-quality news and information more generally. </p><p><span class="bold">Adapting to the New Reality</span></p><p><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Q. </span> I'm curious to hear your $0.02 on how The New York Times has adapted its internal structure over the past few years as the impact of the Internet continues to wipe out major news publications and competitors.  What actions and changes did The Times make leading up to what we see today on NYTimes.com?</span></p><div align="right"><span class="italic"> &#151; Japhet Els, Burlington, Vt.</span></div>
</p><p><span class="bold">A. </span> The media industry has been in the midst of an ongoing dramatic evolution. The New York Times responded by transforming our organization to ensure that we continue to be a global leader in online publishing.  One particularly significant change made several years ago was integrating our print and online newsrooms.  This enables NYTimes.com to tap into the incredible resources available in the print newsroom while infusing our online journalism with cutting-edge technology. Creative developers work side by side with journalists and editors to produce some of the most innovative multimedia content on the Web.  A few recent examples:</p><ul>
<li> &#151; Gail Collins's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109094757/http://nyti.ms/5Y1dRx" target="_blank">year-end quiz</a> </li>
<li> &#151; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109094757/http://nyti.ms/8hs4Ra" target="_blank">Documenting the Decade</a> </li>

<li>  &#151; An<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109094757/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/11/06/business/economy/unemployment-lines.html"> interactive chart</a> that allows readers to select a series of demographic categories and find the unemployment rate for very specific groups.</li>
<li> &#151; A series of interactives accompanying David Rohde's amazing articles about his time as a Taliban captive. The last part of the interactive sequence, linked here, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109094757/http://projects.nytimes.com/held-by-the-taliban/#part-5">a combination of video and animation</a>. The animation is not a dramatization &#151; it is an accurate visualization of David's story, a story that readers would not have "seen" without this kind of treatment.</li>
<li> &#151;  And of course our award-winning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109094757/http://www.nytimes.com/video">original video reports</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>As you can see, The Times places great emphasis on interactivity in general, and information visualization in particular. Our graphics desk, headed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109094757/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/25/business/media/25asktheeditors.html?pagewanted=all">Steve Duenes,</a> Andrew DeVigal's multimedia team and the software developers on Aron Pilhofer's interactive news technologies team work collaboratively to bring to these capabilities to the Web and enhance our storytelling techniques. </p><p><span class="bold">Customizing The Times</span></p><p><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Q. </span>I love the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109094757/http://www.nytimes.com/timesskimmer/">Times Skimmer</a>. Is this a move in response to the bevy of new
e-readers (and rumored iSlate)? It seems like its almost catered to a touch-reliant device. Even if there's no relation, it's great. </span></p><p><div align="right"><span class="italic"> &#151; Craig Villari</span></div></p><p><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Q. </span>I have been in the media space for the last 10+ years.  Am now at Nielsen.  I am an avid reader of the Times, though primarily in digital formats (Kindle subscription, and online daily review &#151; multiple times at day). Was wondering how you are thinking about personalized versions of the product &#151; sort of an MyYahoo approach where you could customize what you see?  Also, are you thinking of a mobile app for Android devices?  I imagine there is an iPhone App - just wanted to see if there was a similar one for my Motorola Droid? </span></p><p> <span class="italic">Best part of the Times for me are the user comments &#151; and I don't mind/actually like the fact that you curate them a bit (highlights, etc).  Keep that up &#151; helpful. </span></p><p><div align="right"><span class="italic"> &#151; Mark Hosbein</span></div></p><p><span class="bold">A. </span>Our strategy at The Times is to produce our content in whatever format the user wants to access it.  We used to refer to this as a platform agnostic approach, and we have long subscribed to the notion that the news matters more than the particular distribution mechanism. We also believe it is next to impossible to "pick the winners" when it comes to specific devices or applications, especially given the rapid pace of change in technology and consumer habits.  Consequently, we have endeavored to provide our content in as many applications and formats as possible, taking somewhat of a venture approach to all these opportunities. </p><p>That said, we have robust news applications for both the iPhone and BlackBerry. Our content is also available on many e-reader devices, such as the Kindle and Sony e-reader. Moreover, we produce our journalism in many different formats such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109094757/http://www.nytimes.com/timesskimmer/">Times Skimmer</a> and Times Reader. We built our own community application (Times People) and actively participate in the social Web through Facebook and Twitter applications. And of course, lets not forget the newspaper itself and this Web site, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109094757/http://www.nytimes.com/">nytimes.com</a>, where most users still encounter our content. While these innovations individually try to capitalize on specific market or technology advances, it is more helpful to view them as the collective embodiment of our desire to execute against our strategic intent. </p><p><span class="bold">The Times as Teaching Tool</span></p><p><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Q. </span>Since elementary school, after being taught how to fold and read the paper properly, Ive enjoyed newspapers.  At the time, it was the St. Louis Globe Democrat with its Sunday comics and the garden section.  Then it was the Post-Dispatch and the Weatherbird cartoon after the Globe folded.  Since moving to NYC in my early twenties, I became a subscriber to the Staten Island Advance when I was on that borough, and after settling into Manhattan
a few years ago, Im now an avid reader of the NYTimes  picking it up on Sundays and reading Gail Collins online. </span></p><p> <span class="italic">Now, I have a daughter who's in kindergarten and loves to read.  She reads story books, comic books, chapter books, deli signs, subway ads, everything. When I'm reading the paper, and doling out sections to friends, I often think how great itd be if there were a section for kids to pass onto her the pleasure of the newspaper.  In my imagination, itd be news stuff that was appropriate for elementary through middle school ... its own great section about positive world events, local coverage, the arts, environmentalism, entertainment reviews, interviews with inspiring kids, comics, poetry, you name it. So, I guess my question is: has The Times ever thought of doing a kids' section? </span></p><p><div align="right"><span class="italic"> &#151; Christine Norrie</span></div></p><p><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Q. </span>As a university lecturer in marketing and business, I find the NY Times to be a very important news source in my teaching.  It is especially useful to have the Times available through the Blackboard system, which many colleges use as their intranet portal. From my standpoint, I see your primary competition as the Wall Street Journal. </span></p><p> <span class="italic">I have 2 questions: First, do you see the Times developing a program, such as the WSJ has, for summarizing and preparing questions to key articles for use by educators? Second, what programs might you entertain for low cost, no cost e-subscriptions for students to the Times?  Most students do not value paper subscriptions, see them as not sustainable ecologically, and only read online content. </span></p><p><div align="right"><span class="italic"> &#151; Bill Troy</span></div></p><p><span class="bold">A. </span> Christine, thank you for supporting our journalism in so many different publishing formats, for sharing our coverage with your friends, and for thinking about cultivating the next generation of Times readers!! You must be an early bloomer, having developed a newspaper readership habit in elementary school! We have not published a kids newspaper for the next generation of Christines because we thought there were better approaches for speaking to this critically important audience. In fact, we have numerous ways for the younger generation to experience The Times. We publish a magazine titled "Upfront" jointly with Scholastic, which is distributed in schools. It contains stories from The Times, along with other news, all edited for the younger audience. </p><p>According to the experts in our education division (and addressing Mr. Troys question as well), The Times has a long and distinguished history with the national educational community. Over the past few years we have grown our presence considerably in the K-12, higher education and lifelong learning arenas.  We provide the service you describe for the K-12 market through our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109094757/http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/">Learning Network</a>, which offers lesson plans that utilize current events and are tagged to national standards. The Learning Network also invites students and teachers all around the world to interact with our content and share what they are teaching or being taught. </p><p>We do not have a business relationship with Blackboard, but we do deliver a full repository of online New York Times content via the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109094757/http://www.epsilen.com/">Epsilen Environment</a>, the primary product of Epsilen LLC, which is majority owned by The New York Times Company. Epsilen is an innovative eLearning platform for both K-12 and higher education that includes lifelong ePortfolios for students and educators, collaboration, assessment and group work tools, and a robust learning management system.  </p><p>With Epsilen, Times content dating back to 1851 is made available for teachers to integrate directly into their lessons.  We also produce online courses that can be included in your curriculum as modules &#151; Times columnists Nicholas Kristof and Gail Collins have both led one-week seminars &#151;  and many professors are finding these online efforts to be a valuable asset in their teaching. More information is available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109094757/http://www.nytimesknownow.com/">The New York Times Knowledge Network</a>'s Web site.   </p><p>My circulation colleagues always like to talk about The Timess extensive tradition of deep involvement with integrating newspapers into the education experience, as we helped launch the initial Newspapers in Education program in the 1930s. That tradition and commitment continues to this day and The New York Times, in print, continues to be a valued resource for college students. While our Web site, NYTimes.com, is also very popular among students, the print edition of our newspaper remains a favorite source for news. </p><p>Among national newspapers, The Times has by far the largest number of copies at colleges across the country.  On a typical in semester day, over 125,000 students and professors at over 1,200 colleges and universities receive the print edition of The Times at our reduced educational rate.  According to the annual survey conducted by Student Monitor, LLC, over 23 percent of all college students read the print edition of The Times in any given week, more than any other newspaper. Currently, more than 2,500 college level educators require that their students read The Times as part of their course.  In addition, thousands more recommend that their students read The Times. </p><p>This has been an extensive answer, but it hopefully provides you and the rest of our readers with a far more comprehensive insight into The New York Timess long-standing commitment to our national educational process, from kindergarten to graduate school to lifelong learning. </p><p><span class="bold">Getting Back to the Article </span></p><p><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Q. </span>I have a Times subscription but tend to spend more time online because of the additional features that you make available online.  But sometimes when I click on a resource thats associated with an article (e.g., some slide shows), I am taken away from the article.  If I make it all the way through a slide presentation, sometimes, I have to click back multiple times to get back to the original article.  But other times, a slide feature pops up in a separate window, and I can just close the window and the article is back.  I prefer that such features open into new windows &#151; and Id guess that most online readers would prefer this approach.  Are there plans to go the second route routinely? Thank you. </span></p><p><div align="right"><span class="italic"> &#151; Don Giller, Cambridge, Mass </span></div></p><p><span class="italic">I like to follow sections in the NY Times, usually starting with World. But if an article is also listed as Business or Health or some other section, when I get to the end of the article, I find it directs me to the next article in Business or Health, etc. instead of the next article in World. Why cant the Web site provide BOTH links? </span></p><p><div align="right"><span class="italic"> &#151; Richard</span></div></p><p><span class="bold">A. </span>We are constantly experimenting with new ways to help readers discover content on our site and delve more deeply into the articles and subjects they are already reading about. </p><p>Later this year, we will be launching a new way for readers to preview the next article in a particular section as they near end of the one they are reading. We are also making other technical changes to resolve the problem of jumping around among different sections.  And last year we released two innovative new products to help readers view and organize our content in new ways: </p><ul>
<li> &#151;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109094757/http://www.nytimes.com/timesskimmer/">Times Skimmer</a> allows you to easily browse various sections with the touch of a cursor key, and presents several options for customizing the look and feel of the display. </li>
<li> &#151; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109094757/http://www.nytimes.com/timeswire/">Times Wire</a> gives you a chronological view of the most recently published content, but also allows you to filter and customize that content so you see articles and multimedia from specific sections.  </li>
</ul>
</p><p>With respect to slide shows and other multimedia elements, our graphics and multimedia teams are constantly experimenting with new ways to tell stories and enhance the traditional narrative. We use a variety of templates depending upon the type of multimedia and its relationship to the article at hand. Our goal is always to allow readers to navigate back to the main article. While there isnt a hard and fast rule, in general, we prefer not to open a new window when you click on a multimedia element but sometimes that isn't the best approach. </p><p><span class="bold">What About Advertising Strategies? </span></p><p><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Q. </span>Regarding online vs. print, I have read that your online edition could potentially be seen by almost 10 times the number of people as that of your print edition. How do you determine the cost of the online ad vs. the print ad? In terms of buying habits, my hunch is that the print reader would be more likely to purchase what he or she has seen in your newspaper, whereas the online reader might just be a browser who stumbled upon your Web site. Do you agree?  Do you see a day when rates for both the online and print ads will be nearly identical or will it always cost more to advertise in print? Ms. Warren, please share your thoughts. </span></p><p><div align="right"><span class="italic"> &#151; David Tulanian, Los Angeles </span></div></p><p><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Q. </span>I would like to know more about how nytimes.com uses behavioral tracking and/or targeting, either of ads of news content. If I look at an article, will your system highlight the photo from a different article when I come back to the home page the next time around? Are the ads shown to me specific to pages, or to my overall behavior?  </span></p><p><div align="right"><span class="italic"> &#151; Chuck Kapelke</span></div></p><p><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Q. </span>Thanks for offering the opportunity to ask you a question about NYT online advertising.  Would it be possible for you to present advertisements based on the article I am reading?  For example, if I am reading the recent story about bicycle speakers I would like to see ads about bicycle products and services.  This would be especially helpful if the ads were from local as well as national firms.  Region specific article ads would also be helpful if the article is presented in response to a search, even if that search is long after the original date of publication. </span></p><p><div align="right"><span class="italic"> &#151; Charles Simon</span></div></p><p><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Q. </span>Do you solicit all the ads on the Times' Web site or do you use any of Google advertising services &#151; or both? </span></p><p><div align="right"><span class="italic"> &#151; Frank Lipsius </span></div></p><p><span class="bold">A. </span> Weve received a number of questions regarding our advertising strategy in the marketplace.  It is great to hear that our readers are interested in the commercial aspects of NYTimes.com. </p><p>The essence of any advertising-based business model is that a content or service is produced, which attracts an audience; the capability to send a message to that audience is then sold to advertisers. </p><p>Sounds pretty simple, right? </p><p>But as you &#151; our sophisticated audience &#151; point out, it is actually quite a complex business and getting more so: behavioral targeting, defining competitors in a world of media convergence, buy and sell side ad networks, targeted creative, managing multiple sales channels and on and on, are just some of the issues we contend with on a daily basis. </p><p>Fortunately, at The Times we can mostly stick to the basics of the ad model I outlined because our advertising customers understand and appreciate the high-quality nature of the products and services we deliver, and realize The Times, in its multiple forms, is a unique and desirable place to reach their important customers. That said, we also try to take advantage of the new capabilities technology is enabling in order to offer our advertisers innovative and creative ways to reach you, the audience, now matter how you choose to interact with us. </p><p>As Mr. Tulanian points out, NYTimes.com has a sizable online audience, which, according to Nielsen, is approximately 17 million unique U.S. monthly readers (internal estimates put this at a much higher number; the difference between external reporting services such as Nielsen and internal numbers involves dealing with an entire set of additional complexities).  And while this audience is larger than our print readership, which is 5.1 million on average (according to Mediamark, another audience research firm), audience size is not the only basis on which advertising is priced. Pricing is more an art than a science; it incorporates size of the audience, level of engagement with the product measured by time spent and/or advertising click through rates (for online ads), ad size, color (for print ads), environment (section of the newspaper or Web site), format (video vs. static ads online), size of the commitment, category of advertising and so forth.  We consider all of these factors, as well as pricing dynamics seen in the marketplace. </p><p>With such a wide variety of advertising, its hard to make direct comparisons between print and online pricing. Its my own view (although there are many theories) that the main reason for print premiums on a per-user-basis has to do with the engagement of the audience on a per-use basis.  For example, while NYTimes.com has one of the highest audience-engagement levels among our cohorts as measured by time spent, the fact is that on a per-use-basis, readers spend more time with the physical newspaper. Nevertheless, the Web allows for engaging creative formats (rich, immersive media and interactivity), as well as targeting capabilities that makes these ads incredibly responsive and effective. </p><p>Speaking of targeting &#151; as Mr. Kapelke and Mr. Simon point out &#151; many publishers offer contextually and behaviorally targeted advertising. The Times does so as well &#151; for example, we target contextually by allowing Broadway shows to target ads to our online Theater section.  We also allow for behaviorally targeted ads, where the same advertiser might target readers with ads around the site, but only those readers who have seen at least six articles in the Theater section in the past month. Its important to note that for all advertising on the site, advertisers are unable to see or use any individually identifiable information on the reader.  They can target a reader based upon what they do, but they will never know who the actual reader is. </p><p>We sell advertising through a single, integrated sales force; therefore we bring multiplatform advertising solutions to our customers. With the demographics of our print and online readers being almost identical, most of our advertisers want to reach our readers on both platforms.  With only 14 percent of our total audience using both products, it also makes sense for advertisers to use both. Our sales team has the primary responsibility of selling the display advertising on the site (the large, graphics-rich ads that appear on most pages). We also work with Google in the sale of the text based ads that appear in light gray boxes further down the page. </p><p>Another lengthy answer I am afraid, but given the complexities of this industry and the sophistication of your questions, this level of detail is necessary. </p><p><span class="bold">Local News and the Future</span></p><p><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Q. </span> May we have a few words concerning the place of The Local in your long-range plans? I enjoy the version that covers my distant, but still loved, home town. However, I note that the blog does not seem to have much in the way of advertising. </span></p><div align="right"><span class="italic"> &#151; Ralph Leonard</span></div>
</p><p><span class="bold">A. </span> Mr. Leonard is asking about the hyperlocal web sites we introduced last March to serve two very different areas: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109094757/http://www.nytimes.com/fortgreene">Fort Greene/Clinton Hill</a> neighborhoods of Brooklyn and the towns of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109094757/http://www.nytimes.com/maplewood">South Orange, Maplewood and Millburn</a> in northern New Jersey. The sites are pilot projects through which were exploring ways for The Times to collaborate with local residents in covering the news of everyday life in their communities. Were also trying to learn whether theres an economically viable way for The Times to participate in this kind of very local coverage.</p><p>Weve focused on the journalism, initially. But today were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109094757/http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=105317&amp;p=irol-pressArticle&amp;ID=1372952&amp;highlight=" target="_blank">announcing</a> a step that we expect will help us learn a lot more not just about journalism, but about the business of hyperlocal. The City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism, which has worked with us from the outset in Brooklyn, is assuming editorial leadership of that site. And under the direction of Prof. Jeff Jarvis, who runs the j-schools Interactive Program and its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109094757/http://newsinnovation.com/about/" target="_blank">New Business Models for News</a> project, we expect the site to develop into a laboratory for studying new ways to support local journalism. Were looking at a range of experimental approaches in New Jersey, too. Stay tuned. </p><p>In the meantime, know that  beyond The Local -- The Times remains strongly committed to covering the New York City market, both in print and online. While metropolitan news is no longer placed in a separate section of the printed paper during the week, for reasons of production-cost savings, the Metro desk is still the largest in our newsroom. Moreover, we continue to provide world-class cultural coverage that has always been a cornerstone for our newspaper and now our Web site, whether the subject is dance, movies, art, books, opera or the theater. Then, of course, there is our in-depth reporting on food, fashion and real estate. All of this and so much more underscores our commitment to covering everything and anything that happens in the greater New York metropolitan area.</p><p id="latest"><span class="bold">Will Mobile Devices Surpass the PC?</span></p><p><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Q. </span> Firstly, do you think that, with the advent of the iPhone and Android platforms, that there will be a day when mobile surpasses content consumption on a PC?</span></p><p><span class="italic">Secondly, how much is The New York Times investing in mobile as a strategy?</span></p><div align="right"><span class="italic"> &#151; Darren Pollard</span></div>
</p><p><span class="bold">A. </span> According to a study released in December by Morgan Stanley, the mobile web is experiencing faster growth than its desktop predecessor ever did.  Morgan Stanley forecasts that more consumers will access the Internet through mobile devices than through personal computers within five years. Their analysts contend that the mobile web growth cycle is just beginning, spurred by the growth and convergence of 3G adoption, social networking, video content, voice-over-Internet and advanced hardware (including smartphones, tablets, e-readers, wireless home appliances and others). </p><p>As you suggest, Darren, companies like Apple and Google, along with Facebook and Amazon.com, are leading innovators on the mobile web.  While Apple currently leads in mobile phone innovation, the long-term winners will probably be determined by how robust their application ecosystems are, the quality of the user experience, and the price.</p><p>The New York Times has been very active in the mobile space. Our mobile traffic has doubled from a year ago.  We have one of the top-ranked mobile news web sites (m.nytimes.com). We also have one of the top news apps in the iPhone app store, as well as apps for Blackberry and Palm Pre; an Android app in the works. The Times is also a leading news publication on Amazons Kindle, and we have plans to make our content available on other e-reading devices in the coming year.</p><p>So, yes, Darren, we have invested heavily in our mobile web activities, and we plan to continue to grow them. Our strategy is to make our content easily accessible to audiences, regardless of the platform.</p><p><nyt_update_bottom>
