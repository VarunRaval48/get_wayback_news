 <p>&#8220;This was not a failure to collect intelligence,&#8221; Mr. Obama said after meeting with his national security team for nearly two hours. &#8220;It was a failure to integrate and understand the intelligence that we already had.&#8221; </p><p>He added: &#8220;We have to do better, we will do better, and we have to do it quickly. American lives are on the line.&#8221;</p><p>The tone of the president&#8217;s remarks on Tuesday &#151; the sharpest of any of his statements since the incident nearly two weeks ago &#151; underscored his anger over the lapses in intelligence as well as his efforts to minimize any political risks from his administration&#8217;s response. </p><p>The president said he was suspending the transfer of detainees from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100107043609/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/national/usstatesterritoriesandpossessions/guantanamobaynavalbasecuba/index.html?inline=nyt-geo" title="More news and information about Guantnamo.">Guant&#225;namo Bay</a> military prison to Yemen, where a Qaeda cell has been connected to the Dec. 25 attack.  While Mr. Obama also renewed his commitment to close the prison, halting the transfer  underscores the difficulty he faces in closing the center and reflects the  criticism  Republicans have directed at the administration. </p><p>Mr. Obama also said that intelligence and law enforcement reviews of the terror plot would be completed this week and that he would announce additional security measures for air travelers in the coming days.</p><p> The statement was Mr. Obama&#8217;s fullest and most forceful to date on the incident, in which a Nigerian man traveling to Detroit from Amsterdam tried to ignite an explosive mixture that could have brought down the Northwest Airlines flight and its 278 passengers.</p><p>&#8220;I want specific recommendations for corrective actions to fix what went wrong,&#8221; said Mr. Obama, who was speaking in the Grand Foyer of the White House. &#8220;I want those reforms implemented immediately, so that this doesn&#8217;t happen again and so we can prevent future attacks.&#8221;</p><p> Mr. Obama&#8217;s stark assessment that the government failed to properly analyze and integrate intelligence served as a sharp rebuke of the country&#8217;s intelligence agencies, including the National Counterterrorism Center, the organization set up after the Sept. 11 attacks to ensure that the government had a central clearinghouse for spotting, assessing and thwarting terrorist threats. </p><p>But Mr. Obama insisted that he was not interested in getting into a blame game. White House officials said the president was standing by his top national security advisers, including those whose agencies failed to communicate with one another.</p><p>In a meeting with those officials on Tuesday, the president called the events leading up to the attempted Christmas Day attack a &#8220;screwup,&#8221; one White House official said, and told the assembled officials, &#8220;We dodged a bullet, but just barely.&#8221; Mr. Obama, the official said, also told the group that he would not &#8220;tolerate&#8221; finger-pointing. </p><p>In his remarks to reporters after the meeting, the president called the threat against the United States &#8220;a challenge of the utmost urgency.&#8221; He suggested that the passengers aboard the Northwest Airlines flight were lucky to skirt disaster and warned that future attacks might not be thwarted unless communication improved among intelligence officials.</p><p> &#8220;I will accept that intelligence by its nature is imperfect, but it is increasingly clear that intelligence was not fully analyzed or fully leveraged,&#8221; Mr. Obama said. &#8220;That&#8217;s not acceptable, and I will not tolerate it.&#8221;</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100107043609/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/dennis_c_blair/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Dennis Blair.">Dennis C. Blair</a>, the director of national intelligence, said in a statement on Tuesday evening that the &#8220;intelligence community received the president&#8217;s message today &#151; we got it.&#8221; He acknowledged the failures, but added, &#8220;We can and we must outthink, outwork and defeat the enemy&#8217;s new ideas.&#8221;</p><p>In the meeting, officials did not blame the organization of the intelligence or homeland security agencies, which were set up under the Bush administration, but rather how the information was analyzed.</p><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a structure problem,&#8221; said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100107043609/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/denis_mcdonough/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Denis McDonough.">Denis McDonough</a>, the chief of staff of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100107043609/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_security_council/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about National Security Council, U.S.">National Security Council</a>. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t a problem of intelligence sharing, but rather a problem related to ensuring that all the wealth of information we had was appropriately correlated, analyzed and highlighted.&#8221;</p><p>The decision to suspend the transfer of detainees from  Guant&#225;namo Bay to Yemen because of the rising terror threats emanating from the country was another tacit acknowledgment of how difficult it will be to close the prison. Nearly half of the remaining detainees are from Yemen, senior administration officials said.</p><p>Mr. Obama was already poised to miss his self-imposed one-year deadline for shuttering the prison by Jan. 22, but evidence that a Qaeda branch in Yemen was behind the failed Christmas Day attack means the administration will fall even further behind schedule. </p><p>Mr. Obama inherited 242 detainees at Guant&#225;namo when he took office, and so far he has released or transferred 44. Of the 198 remaining, about 92 are from Yemen. Of those, just under 40 have been cleared for release, a senior administration official said.</p><p>But the official said the administration had already decided before the attempted attack that it would slow down the release of the remaining Yemeni detainees. The administration sent six detainees back to Yemen just before Christmas, in a move that drew criticism from Republicans, including Senators <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100107043609/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/lindsey_graham/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Lindsey Graham.">Lindsey Graham</a> of South Carolina and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100107043609/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/john_mccain/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about John McCain.">John McCain</a> of Arizona, as well as Senator <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100107043609/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/joseph_i_lieberman/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Joseph I.

That criticism did not come until after the administration had already sent the men back.</p><p>Mr. Obama did not disclose what changes might be in store at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100107043609/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/a/airport_security/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about airport security.">airport security</a> checkpoints, but transportation security officials have already been in contact with equipment manufacturers to find out what capacity they have to increase production of whole-body scanners, which can help detect hidden weapons or explosives.</p><p>So far, there are only 40 of these devices in place at 19 airports nationwide in a domestic aviation system that has more than 2,200 checkpoint security lanes. An additional 150 machines were recently ordered and are in the process of being delivered. </p><p> Industry officials said they expected a request for 300 more machines, which would result in a total of nearly 500 devices, still covering just a small fraction of the checkpoint lanes, but perhaps enough to have them at most of the major airports in the United States. The machines cost about $190,000 a piece.</p><nyt_author_id><div id="authorId"><p> Eric Lipton contributed reporting.</p></div></nyt_author_id><nyt_update_bottom>
