 <p> Haiti&#8217;s long history of foreign intervention, including an American occupation, normally makes the influx of foreigners a delicate issue.</p><p> But with the government of President <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121043139/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/rene_preval/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Rene Preval">Ren&#233; Pr&#233;val</a> largely out of public view and the needs so huge, many Haitians are shunting aside their concerns about sovereignty and welcoming anybody willing to help &#151; in camouflage or not.</p><p>&#8220;It is not ideal to have a foreign army here, but look at the situation,&#8221; said &#201;nide Edoword, 24, a waitress who was standing in a camp of displaced people. &#8220;We are living amid filth and hunger and thirst after a catastrophe.&#8221;</p><p>When Mr. Pr&#233;val asked religious and business leaders at a meeting on Saturday whether they supported the intervention of the United States <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121043139/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/m/us_marine_corps/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about United States Marine Corps">Marines</a>, the response came with a caveat.</p><p> &#8220;They said, &#8216;Yes &#151; as long as it&#8217;s temporary,&#8217;&#160;&#8221; said Bishop Jean-Zache Duracin of Haiti&#8217;s Episcopal Church, who attended the meeting. &#8220;We have no choice because the government has collapsed.&#8221; </p><p> At the international airport, where the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121043139/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/us_air_force/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about U.S. Air Force">United States Air Force</a> now controls incoming and departing planes, Haitian officials are on hand and insist that it is still theirs, even if it more resembles a military base.</p><p>&#8220;We are like a country whose capital has been hit by two atomic bombs,&#8221; said Patrick Elie, a presidential adviser and former defense minister.</p><p> &#8220;We are obviously in a moment of disarray, if not pain, and we have to regroup,&#8221; he added. &#8220;But let no one point a finger and say, &#8216;Where is the state?&#8217; People who say that don&#8217;t understand the extent of the damage.&#8221;</p><p>But many were still pointing fingers.</p><p>&#8220;We have a vacuum of government,&#8221; asserted Mich&#232;le Pierre-Louis, who had been Mr. Pr&#233;val&#8217;s prime minister until she was ousted a few months ago. &#8220;The big question is, Who&#8217;s in charge? We don&#8217;t feel as though there is someone organizing all this.&#8221;</p><p>Mr. Pr&#233;val, an aloof leader even in the best of times, huddled with advisers on Tuesday at a compact police station that has become the government&#8217;s de-facto headquarters. Aides described him as being as traumatized by the recent events as every other Haitian but still fully engaged in the nation&#8217;s recovery. </p><p>They said he and his ministers were engaged in a furious effort to organize all the outside aid, find refuge for the hundreds of thousands of people living in the streets and bury bodies, thousands and thousands of which have been collected and put in mass graves so far as of Tuesday morning. (There is still no widely accepted death toll.)</p><p> They said the president would soon address the nation for the first time since the quake struck on Jan. 12. </p><p>But the international effort has far outpaced anything Haiti could manage: supply flights from around the world continued to arrive in numbers, though aid groups complained of being turned away.</p><p> In New York, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121043139/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about the United Nations.">United Nations</a> secretary general, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121043139/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/ban_ki_moon/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Ban Ki-moon.">Ban Ki-moon</a>, said that  the United Nations&#8217; food agency had distributed rations for 200,000 people so far, and other officials said the aim was to quickly supply 4.2 million rations of high-nutrition food for children. </p><p>Mr. Ban said the agency was aiming to feed one million people by the end of this week and two million by the end of next week &#151; though three million or more people are estimated to need food. </p><p>In Port-au-Prince, the capital, foreign rescue teams scoured buildings  for survivors under the rubble. A joint New York City Police-Fire rescue team on Tuesday pulled out two children from the rubble of a collapsed building in the capital, The Associated Press reported. A police spokesman, Paul J. Browne, said that the 8-year-old boy and the 10-year-old girl were taken to an Israeli tent hospital for treatment, The A.P. reported.  Foreign doctors provided medical care and carried out scores of life-saving amputations.</p><p>But the demand for medical care far outstripped the supply of doctors. Debarati Guha-Sapir, a professor of epidemiology and the director of the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters at the University of Louvain in Belgium, said that deaths in large earthquakes generally declined after the first day or two. </p><div id="pageLinks"><ul id="pageNumbers"><li> 1 </li><li> <a onclick="s_code_linktrack('Article-MultiPagePageNum2');" title="Page 2" href="/web/20100121043139/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/world/americas/20haiti.html?pagewanted=2&amp;em">2</a> </li></ul><a class="next" onclick="s_code_linktrack('Article-MultiPage-Next');" title="Next Page" href="/web/20100121043139/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/world/americas/20haiti.html?pagewanted=2&amp;em">Next Page &#x00bb;</a></div><nyt_author_id><div id="authorId"><p> Ray Rivera and Ginger Thompson contributed reporting from Port-au-Prince, and Neil MacFarquhar from the United Nations.</p></div></nyt_author_id><nyt_update_bottom>
