    <p>PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti &#151; Almost every wing of St.-Fran&#231;ois de Sales Hospital lies in ruins. But about 68 doctors and nurses have turned what is left into a triage center that performed at least 17 operations Tuesday.</p>

 <p>The collapse of the Lyc&#233;e Marie-Jeanne, a school for girls, has turned it into a crypt for scores of eighth graders. But staff members report there daily to comb through the debris for whatever they can salvage to help reopen the school.</p><p>A dozen officers were killed when last week&#8217;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121045441/http://www.nytimes.com/info/haiti-earthquake-2010/?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.">earthquake</a> flattened the police precinct at Delmas 32. But those who are left have filled the open shifts and organized meetings with residents to discuss strategies for fending off looters.</p><p>One week after the disaster that left Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas in ruins, the toll on this country has been measured almost entirely in lives. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121045441/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/haiti/index.html?inline=nyt-geo" title="More news and information about Haiti.">Haiti</a>&#8217;s institutions, weak as they were, have been grievously wounded, too. A day immersed in this country&#8217;s struggle to recover makes it clear that their absence leaves a palpable void.</p><p>&#8220;The country was fairly dysfunctional before this,&#8221; said former Prime Minister Mich&#232;le Pierre-Louis. &#8220;The institutions were weak. People were left largely on their own. But this has wiped out everything.&#8221;</p><p>While the world has rushed to rescue those trapped in the rubble, and provide assistance to the tens of thousands left without shelter, food and water, Haitians have jumped in as well to help the relief effort, to slowly begin the gargantuan task of digging out and carrying on. </p><p>Fledgling efforts were visible in Peguyville, where leaders have organized camps filled with thousands of those left homeless into committees responsible for everything from security to burning trash. </p><p>Haitians in Carrefour have volunteered with Adventist missionaries to help operate feeding programs and water purification stations. And at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121045441/http://www.ueh.edu.ht/" title="University?s Web site (in French).">University of Haiti</a>, professors summoned students by text messages and deputized them to serve as trauma counselors for a shocked population.</p><p>&#8220;The state is broken, the people are broken, but it is time to mobilize,&#8221; said Tirone Jo&#235;l, 24, a psychology student. &#8220;We can sit back and wait for help from our friends abroad, or we can use our own talents and take charge of one little corner of this situation.&#8221;</p><p>Every corner of the courtyard at St.-Fran&#231;ois de Sales Hospital was occupied by people wounded in the earthquake. Medical experts said that the hospital was considered a reference center for the country, and that it trained dozens of doctors, nurses and lab technicians each year.</p><p>Established by nuns in the late 1800s, the hospital reserves half of its 140 beds for the poor. Since the earthquake, a wing of the dormitory has been converted to operating rooms that are managed by a 73-year-old nurse named Maxis Astevelne.</p><p>Stepping away from an operating table where doctors were suturing the skull of an 8-year-old boy, the nurse said she was proud of the way her colleagues had pulled together to save lives.</p><p>Her own husband&#8217;s body still lay beneath the rubble of her house, she said. But she has been at the hospital every day to help get it up and running.</p><p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t get paid much,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And we don&#8217;t have all the equipment we want. But we do the best with what God has given us.&#8221;</p><p>The earthquake struck the police precinct at Delmas 32 at shift change. And officers there consider it a major miracle that all but 12 officers escaped the station house before it collapsed.</p><p>After days of disarray, the officers reported to the station on Saturday to bury one of their shift commanders and 11 other colleagues in a pit behind the commissary. On Saturday afternoon, officers were out on motorbikes looking for fuel for their police cars, and that night a reduced force was out on patrol.</p><p>The threat of mass looting seems to increase by the day. And the police here have long been outmatched by criminal gangs in money and guns. Inspector Thelemarque Dielph was resigned to accepting help from abroad. </p><p> &#8220;Smart people know what they can do by themselves,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and also what they cannot do.&#8221;</p><p>The water system in Haiti before the earthquake may not have been fair or ideal: rich neighborhoods and hotels received chlorinated water from one set of pipes, while everyone else relied on city water pumped in for part of the day, augmented by water trucks that appeared daily in neighborhoods. Still, most of the sprawling city had access to water. </p><div id="pageLinks"><ul id="pageNumbers"><li> 1 </li><li> <a onclick="s_code_linktrack('Article-MultiPagePageNum2');" title="Page 2" href="/web/20100121045441/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/world/americas/20services.html?pagewanted=2">2</a> </li></ul><a class="next" onclick="s_code_linktrack('Article-MultiPage-Next');" title="Next Page" href="/web/20100121045441/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/world/americas/20services.html?pagewanted=2">Next Page &#x00bb;</a></div><nyt_author_id><div id="authorId"><p>Damien Cave and Marc Lacey contributed reporting.</p></div></nyt_author_id><nyt_update_bottom>
