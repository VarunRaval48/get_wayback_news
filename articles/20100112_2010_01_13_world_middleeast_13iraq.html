    <p>BAGHDAD &#151; A wide-ranging plot to bomb government ministries and other public places, to be  followed by a wave of political assassinations, was uncovered by Iraqi officials, who responded Tuesday by bringing much of Baghdad to a virtual standstill while security forces conducted raids that netted large quantities of explosives, officials said.</p>

 <p>At least 4 suicide car bombers &#151; and as many as 10  &#151; were apparently on their way to government buildings on Tuesday morning  when they were stopped by the police and arrested, the authorities said.</p><p>During raids on houses and warehouses in Baghdad that lasted throughout the day, the authorities arrested 25 people and recovered more than 440 pounds each of TNT and C-4, about 66 gallons of ammonium nitrate solution  and 60 mortar shells, according to a statement from Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, a spokesman for Baghdad Operations Command, which is responsible for security in Baghdad, the capital.</p><p>Even by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100114041657/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iraq/index.html?inline=nyt-geo" title="More news and information about Iraq.">Iraq</a>&#8217;s violent standards in recent years  &#151;  in which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100114041657/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/26/world/middleeast/26iraq.html" title="Related article.">mammoth explosions</a> have become a possibility of everyday life in Baghdad  &#151;  the plot discovered by the Iraqi government on Tuesday would have been devastating if carried out. </p><p>The American military and the Iraqi government have said they expect violence to increase sharply with the approach of the country&#8217;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100114041657/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/world/middleeast/09iraq.html" title="Related article.">scheduled</a> March 7 national elections as political parties vie for advantage and insurgents seek to spread chaos.</p><p>Government officials said the plot had involved sending suicide bombers, their vehicles packed with explosives, to blow themselves up at the Ministries of Defense, Health and Trade, and at other public places, including markets. </p><p>Other insurgents would then have been sent to assassinate political and tribal leaders, two security officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the news media.</p><p>&#8220;The situation is now stable,&#8221; said Ali al-Dabbagh, the spokesman for Prime Minister <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100114041657/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/nuri_kamal_al-maliki/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Nuri Kamal al-Maliki.">Nuri Kamal al-Maliki</a>. &#8220;Security officials have now controlled all the key areas. There is nothing to worry about.&#8221;</p><p>The government did not immediately say who it thought was responsible for the plot, but it has said in the past that elements of the outlawed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100114041657/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/b/baath_party/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Baath Party.">Baath Party</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100114041657/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/al_qaeda_in_mesopotamia/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.">Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia</a> were behind such attacks.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100114041657/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/26/world/middleeast/26iraq.html" title="Times article">A series of bombings outside or near government buildings</a> since August have killed more than 400 people and wounded more than 1,500 in Baghdad, leading to deep public skepticism about the ability of the country&#8217;s security forces to adequately protect people.</p><p>Mr. Dabbagh said at a news conference that the plot appeared to have been hatched to disrupt the coming election. The balloting is regarded as a crucial test of Iraq&#8217;s fragile democracy, and its outcome could determine whether American forces are able to withdraw from the country on schedule by the end of 2011.</p><p>&#8220;These groups that are targeting the election and the political process want to confuse the public,&#8221; Mr. Dabbagh said. &#8220;They want to bury this dream that all of us are waiting for.&#8221;</p><p>Plans for the election have already become problematic. Last week, a parliamentary committee empowered to evaluate candidates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100114041657/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/08/world/middleeast/08iraq.html" title="Times article">rejected the party led by Saleh al-Mutlaq, a prominent Sunni</a>, and other political parties, accusing them of ties to the Baath Party of former President <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100114041657/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/saddam_hussein/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Saddam Hussein.">Saddam Hussein</a>, which is banned by the Constitution.</p><p>Sunnis largely boycotted the 2005 parliamentary elections, giving Shiite Muslims and Kurds disproportionate power in Parliament and prompting increased violence in the country.</p><p>There have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100114041657/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/09/world/middleeast/09baghdad.html" title="Related article.">protests in various Sunni areas</a> of the country since the committee&#8217;s decision, and there are fears that some of Mr. Mutlaq&#8217;s Sunni supporters might respond with violence.</p><p>The Shiite-led government forcefully denounced persistent rumors that a military unit sympathetic to Mr. Mutlaq might have had a role in the plot on Tuesday. </p><p>&#8220;All these rumors are meant to shake the trust of citizens in their armed forces,&#8221; said Maj. Gen. Mohammed al-Askari, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense. &#8220;The Iraqi Army is a professional organization and takes its orders from the commander in chief.&#8221; </p><p>Hussein al-Shaalan, a member of Parliament&#8217;s defense and security committee, who said he had been briefed by Iraqi security officials about the plot, said it had been thwarted with the help of the American military.</p><p>The Americans, Mr. Shaalan said he had been told, notified the Iraqi government Monday evening that eight bomb-laden vehicles had entered Baghdad.</p><p>The American military in Iraq had no immediate comment. </p><p>General Askari said Iraqi security officials had not ordered a curfew in Baghdad until about 6 a.m. Tuesday because they did not want to tip off the suspects.</p><p>&#8220;The security forces received information about areas used to make a car bomb and explosive belts in which they wanted to carry out attacks against crowds of people and vital establishments,&#8221;  General Askari said. &#8220;We would have lost the opportunity to raid targets if we&#8217;d made the announcement earlier.&#8221;</p><p>Additional intelligence was culled by both American and Iraqi sources, and included the use of a phone intercept, officials said.</p><p>&#8220;The information was trusted, highly credible and specific,&#8221; said Mr. Dabbagh, who said an Iraqi citizen was among those who had provided important details to the authorities.</p><p>With security forces raiding buildings and the police searching for suicide car bombs, much of Baghdad was virtually locked down Tuesday morning. The bridges over the Tigris River were closed, and traffic was halted at Baghdad&#8217;s  myriad checkpoints. Vehicles were prevented from entering or leaving the city for several hours.</p><p>Once cars were allowed to pass, all vehicles and their passengers were searched. Many schools were closed, and amid the confusion many people never made it to work.</p><p>In another development, three Iraqi police officers were killed by a car bomb on Tuesday in Diyala Province, northeast of Baghdad, the authorities said.</p><nyt_author_id><div id="authorId"><p>Reporting was contributed by Mohammed Hussein, Riyadh Mohammed, Nada Bakri and Anwar J.
