    <p>PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti &#151; Wharf J&#233;r&#233;mie on this city&#8217;s edge was all chaos and destruction on Monday, with upturned shipping containers lying in the sea and pigs foraging on piles of refuse. But for a thousand or more seeking a ride on rickety boats away from the ruined capital, the wharf was a means to something hopeful: escape.</p>

 <p>&#8220;Our home is destroyed,&#8221; said Yanique Verly, 33, who sells vegetables on the street. She waited for a boat to take her and her three children to her home on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121043130/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/haiti/index.html?inline=nyt-geo" title="More news and information about Haiti.">Haiti</a>&#8217;s western coast. &#8220;My only hope is to return to my family&#8217;s arms.&#8221;</p><p>Ms. Verly joined thousands of others, as the exodus from the capital accelerated on Monday, by boat, bus, car and truck, in uncertain quest for shelter, fresh water and stability in the countryside. They sought to leave an anarchic city marked by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121043130/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/world/americas/17haiti.html" title="Times article">acute shortages of basic goods and aid efforts hampered by bottlenecks and security fears.</a></p><p>There seemed to be no certainty on any front, not even on the death toll from the huge earthquake that struck last Tuesday. Alain Le Roy, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121043130/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about the United Nations.">United Nations</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121043130/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations/department_of_peacekeeping_operations/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about U.N. peacekeeping.">peacekeeping</a> chief, said he could not confirm estimates of as many as 200,000 dead. </p><p>He said that as far as he knew, the toll had not surpassed 50,000 dead. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think anybody knows, to be frank,&#8221; he told reporters in New York. </p><p>One clear thing was the need to leave. Bus after bus lined up at gas stations throughout the city, hoping to fill up with fuel before beginning the long trek into Haiti&#8217;s interior. Some people lugged overstuffed suitcases; others carried little more than the clothes they were wearing and enough money to pay the new, higher fares.</p><p>At one gas station, the messages on some buses, painted in bright colors above their windshields, evoked something more than hope: Christ Est la R&#233;ponse (Christ Is the Answer) and Courage Mon Fr&#232;re (Courage, My Brother).</p><p> &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m coming back,&#8221; said Marcelaine Calixte, 20, a student whose house and college had collapsed, sitting on a crowded bus Monday afternoon headed to Les Cayes, a southern town.</p><p>Lt. Cmdr. Christopher O&#8217;Neil said the Coast Guard had not spotted any boats Monday leaving Haiti with refugees. </p><p> &#8220;None, zero,&#8221; he said when asked about Haitians taking to the sea, &#8220;and no indication of anyone making preparations to do so.&#8221;</p><p> He said it was highly unlikely that migrants would attempt the journey with five cutters right off the coast, not to mention the presence of an aircraft carrier and other ships from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121043130/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/us_navy/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about United States Navy">United States Navy</a>. He said anyone caught leaving the island and heading toward Florida would be returned to Haiti.</p><p>Nevertheless, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121043130/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/n/janet_napolitano/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Janet Napolitano.">Janet Napolitano</a>, the homeland security secretary, said the United States would permit orphaned children from Haiti to enter the country temporarily to make sure that they received necessary medical care. The policy will apply to children who are being adopted by American citizens or who have been identified as eligible for adoption in the United States.</p><p>For every person who found an option for shelter or food outside the capital, many more did not or could not.</p><p>&#8220;I would like for my family to escape the misery in this city, but I need painkillers for my child first,&#8221; said Manuel Lamy, 28, a plumber whose 5-year-old daughter, Yvenca, had lost her left hand. Mr. Lamy and his wife, Sagine Oscar, 30, took her to a triage center set up by Cuban doctors.</p><p>The displaced were streaming out of Port-au-Prince even as more relief, aid workers and American troops were arriving. Some hospitals along the border with the Dominican Republic were swamped with earthquake victims.</p><p>The United Nations <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121043130/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_food_program/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about the World Food Program">World Food Program</a> said it planned to distribute 200 tons of food on Monday to 95,000 people at eight locations and appealed anew for public donations. Aid workers, mobile clinics and other supplies continued to be flown in to the airport and come overland from the Dominican Republic.</p><p>Rescue workers from around the world searched for any last survivors, sometimes clashing over which team ought to be in charge of what.</p><p>The United Nations secretary general, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121043130/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/ban_ki_moon/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Ban Ki-moon.">Ban Ki-moon</a>, requested Monday that the Security Council immediately approve an additional 3,500 security officers for Haiti, both to maintain public order and to guard deliveries as the aid effort gathers steam.</p><p>Mr. Ban requested that the Council send 1,500 more police officers and 2,000 troops for at least six months to augment the 9,000 already here. So far, violence has been scattered, with the security situation over all fairly calm. But senior United Nations officials said it might boil over at any moment as the difficulties of living without water, food and shelter mount.</p><p>&#8220;We need to be very much careful and vigilant against any possibility,&#8221; Mr. Ban said in an interview. &#8220;When their patience level becomes thinner &#151; that is when we have to be concerned.&#8221;</p><div id="pageLinks"><ul id="pageNumbers"><li> 1 </li><li> <a onclick="s_code_linktrack('Article-MultiPagePageNum2');" title="Page 2" href="/web/20100121043130/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/19/world/americas/19haiti.html?pagewanted=2&amp;bl">2</a> </li></ul><a class="next" onclick="s_code_linktrack('Article-MultiPage-Next');" title="Next Page" href="/web/20100121043130/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/19/world/americas/19haiti.html?pagewanted=2&amp;bl">Next Page &#x00bb;</a></div><nyt_author_id><div id="authorId"><p>Ginger Thompson contributed reporting from Port-au-Prince, James C.
