The city&#8217;s archbishop, Msgr. Joseph Serge Miot, was feared dead. </p><p>And the poor who define this nation squatted in the streets, some hurt and bloody, many more without food and water, close to piles of covered corpses and rubble. Limbs protruded from disintegrated concrete, muffled cries emanated from deep inside the wrecks of buildings &#151; many of them poorly constructed in the first place &#151; as Haiti struggled to grasp the unknown toll from its worst earthquake in more than 200 years. </p><p>In the midst of the chaos, no one was able to offer an estimate of the number of people who had been killed or injured, though there was widespread concern that there were likely to be thousands of casualties.</p><p>&#8220;Please save my baby!&#8221; Jeudy Francia, a woman in her 20s, shrieked outside the St.-Esprit Hospital in the city. Her child, a girl about 4 years old, writhed in pain in the hospital&#8217;s chaotic courtyard, near where a handful of corpses lay under white blankets. &#8220;There is no one, nothing, no medicines, no explanations for why my daughter is going to die.&#8221; </p><p>Governments and aid agencies from Beijing to Grand Rapids began marshaling supplies and staffs to send here, though the obstacles proved frustrating just one day after the powerful 7.0-magnitude earthquake hit. Power and phone service were out. Flights were severely limited at Port-au-Prince&#8217;s main airport, telecommunications were barely functioning, operations at the port were shut down and most of the medical facilities had been severely damaged, if not leveled.</p><p>A Red Cross field team of officials from several nations had to spend Wednesday night in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic to gather its staff before taking the six-hour drive in the morning across the border to the earthquake zone.</p><p>&#8220;We were on the plane here with a couple of different agencies, and they all are having similar challenges of access,&#8221; Colin Chaperon, a field director for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121044714/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/american_red_cross/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about American Red Cross">American Red Cross</a>, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;There is a wealth of resources out there, and everybody has the good will to go in and support the Haitian Red Cross.&#8221;</p><p>The quake <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121044714/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/recenteqsww/" title="Report on the quake on the U.S.G.S.

He described the reports of destruction as &#8220;truly heart-wrenching,&#8221; made more cruel given Haiti&#8217;s long-troubled circumstances. Mr. Obama did not make a specific aid pledge, and administration officials said they were still trying to figure out what the nation needed. But he urged Americans to  go to the White House&#8217;s Web site, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121044714/http://www.whitehouse.gov/" title="White House Web site">www.whitehouse.gov</a>, to find ways to donate money. </p><p>&#8220;This is a time when we are reminded of the common humanity that we all share,&#8221; Mr. Obama said, speaking in the morning in the White House diplomatic reception room with Vice President <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100121044714/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/joseph_r_jr_biden/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Joseph R.
