 <p>The worldwide rush to provide aid to the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere was immediate and enormous. But the logistics of getting help to Haiti proved a frustrating challenge a day after the quake. </p><p>Flights were severely limited at Port-au-Prince&#8217;s main airport, telecommunications were barely functioning, operations at the port were shut down, and most of the medical facilities were severely damaged, if not simply razed. Some aid agencies were still trying to account for missing workers, while others found that merely entering the country was a difficult task. </p><p>A Red Cross field team, made up of officials from several nations, had to spend the night in Santo Domingo in the  Dominican Republic to gather its staff before taking the six-hour drive in the morning across the border to the earthquake zone. </p><p>&#8220;We were on the plane here with a couple of different agencies and they all are having similar challenges of access,&#8221; Colin Chaperon, the field director for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100114074907/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/american_red_cross/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about American Red Cross">American Red Cross</a>, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;There is a wealth of resources out there, and everybody has the good will to go in and support the Haitian Red Cross.&#8221;</p><p>But the conditions, he said, could be turning even more dangerous. &#8220;Obviously it&#8217;s a densely populated area and there have been reports of looting,&#8221; Mr. Chaperon said. &#8220;Clearly, there&#8217;s a big need to get the search and rescue efforts under way.&#8221; </p><p> Medical personnel from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100114074907/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/d/doctors_without_borders/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Doctors Without Borders">Doctors Without Borders</a>, which had 800 people already in Haiti before the earthquake, established  tents for triage and to accommodate patients evacuated from severely damaged hospitals. But they were mobbed by people who had suffered severe traumas and crushed limbs, and by others begging for help in rescuing trapped relatives. </p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very chaotic situation,&#8221; said Paul McPhun, a director of the emergency management team for Doctors Without Borders, based in Toronto. </p><p> &#8220;We&#8217;re looking at private charter options, looking at getting people through the Dominican Republic,&#8221; Mr. McPhun said on a conference call with reporters Wednesday morning. &#8220;We need to get people in, and get people fast. There&#8217;s not a shortage of getting people to go, but it&#8217;s how to get them there.&#8221;</p><p>Many international relief agencies have large presences in Haiti, not only for disaster relief from two <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100114074907/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/hurricanes_and_tropical_storms/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about hurricanes.">hurricanes</a> in 2008, but for AIDS education and other social and economic issues plaguing the nation. On Wednesday, religious-based and other non-profit organizations rapidly developed aid plans and quickly raised millions of dollars through social networking sites and other technologies. </p><p>The Pentagon said it was sending an aircraft carrier, the Carl Vinson based in Norfolk, Va., to Haiti. It is expected to arrive by Friday and serve as an offshore staging area for helicopters and air support for the island. General Douglas Fraser, commander of the U.S. Southern Command, said he was also considering sending an amphibious assault ship with an expeditionary unit of roughly 2,000 marines to help maintain security in the Haitian capital, which he said was &#8220;a serious concern.&#8221;</p><p>The United States Coast Guard dispatched four cutters, some equipped with helicopters, to Haiti early Wednesday morning.</p><p> France said it would send three military transport planes  with aid supplies, and that 100 troops based in the French West Indies would be sent to help, according to TF1, a French television network. Britain, China, and Germany were sending assessment teams, and  pledging financial support. . </p><p>Robyn Fieser, the regional information officer for Catholic Relief Services, said her office was able contact some of its 300 relief workers in Haiti overnight. Its Port-au-Prince office was still standing, and some workers slept outside overnight there, afraid or unable to get through rubble-blocked streets.</p><p>&#8220;All they heard last night was chanting and praying,&#8221; Ms. Fieser said by telephone from her office in Baltimore, Md.. &#8220;They did not hear any emergency vehicles or emergency efforts at all. All they saw was people doing rescue work on their own, with their bare hands.&#8221;</p><p>Caring for children was of immediate concern to at least two organizations with offices already in Haiti. Caryl Stern, chief executive officer of the U.S. Fund for Unicef, said that all but three of the 100 workers were accounted for on Wednesday. After helping communities with rescue efforts, she said her agency would gather unaccompanied children and &#8220;create safe havens,&#8221; for them and then focus on curbing diseases and providing clean water.</p><div id="pageLinks"><ul id="pageNumbers"><li> 1 </li><li> <a onclick="s_code_linktrack('Article-MultiPagePageNum2');" title="Page 2" href="/web/20100114074907/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/world/americas/14aid.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ref=world">2</a> </li></ul><a class="next" onclick="s_code_linktrack('Article-MultiPage-Next');" title="Next Page" href="/web/20100114074907/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/world/americas/14aid.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ref=world">Next Page &#x00bb;</a></div><nyt_author_id><div id="authorId"><p>Reporting was contributed by Maria Newman and Jon Elsen from New York, and Brian Knowlton, Eric Lipton and Elisabeth Bumiller from Washington.</p></div></nyt_author_id><nyt_update_bottom>
