 <p>This dizzying two hours of traffic features a cast of characters unlikely to be assembled anywhere else, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130616234858/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/warren_g_harding/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Warren G. Harding.">Warren G. Harding</a> and Henry Cabot Lodge, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130616234858/http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/c/carol_channing/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Carol Channing.">Carol Channing</a>, a cantankerous playwright more or less affixed to his toilet, his nagging giant of a wife and a mysterious talking orb. These oddly assorted beings reel through &#8220;an epic burlesque of tragic proportion,&#8221; as the play is subtitled, while the curtain rises and falls at a frenetic pace on scenes that hurtle from a fairy-tale landscape to the smoky back rooms of a hotel in Chicago in 1920. Blink and you miss World War I.</p><p>How, you may well wonder, did the small but enterprising Foundry Theater, which is presenting this revival of Mr. Greenspan&#8217;s fantastical-historical extravaganza, manage to come up with the budget for a spectacle of this magnitude? How did the company cram it on the Atlantic Theater&#8217;s small second stage? In what prop shop do you order up a talking orb? </p><p>These and other logistical problems were solved by dispensing with a few unnecessary items. Like all actors, save Mr. Greenspan. And all scenery except a single chair. And that curtain. </p><p>Strictly speaking &#8220;The Myopia&#8221; is a one-man show, the brown paper bag of contemporary New York theater. Yet you emerge from this brilliant and bewildering production, directed by Brian Mertes, feeling dazzled and disoriented, as if you&#8217;d just seen a splashy Disney musical crossed with a Greek tragedy and a kitchen-sink drama, or maybe an evening of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130616234858/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/samuel_beckett/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Samuel Beckett.">Samuel Beckett</a> plays as staged by Florenz Ziegfeld.</p><p>With this unique and strangely bewitching work Mr. Greenspan, a quirky downtown actor and an avant-garde playwright, proves himself once again to be a theatrical conjurer of rare gifts. Using just the words he has written and the music of his voice, he fills the imagination of the audience with images of pathos and comedy, of fantasy and absurdity, that do not exactly cohere to create a sensible narrative  &#151;  au contraire!  &#151;  but leave a fizzy sense of excitement, the giddy elation that follows a great fireworks display. </p><p>This effect, I should note, will best be felt by theater aficionados happy to travel to the outer fringes of the contemporary scene. &#8220;Meta&#8221; could be Mr. Greenspan&#8217;s middle name, and &#8220;The Myopia&#8221; begins with a wordy disquisition on his thinking about theater. Discoursing on the difference between movies and plays, Mr. Greenspan says, &#8220;I&#8217;ve thought about the theater because it is not a picture, thinking instead it is what is happening in it.&#8221; O.K., I think I follow you. &#8220;And that no matter what is happening in it  &#151;  even if what is pictured happening has already happened, or didn&#8217;t happen, or never happened, or never will happen  &#151;  you know on some level (and I think you know you know), something is actually happening.&#8221; </p><p>Does the spiraling logic bring anyone to mind? A famous modernist writer known for her taffylike prose? Think: A rose is a rose is a rose. Yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130616234858/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/gertrude_stein/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Gertrude Stein.">Gertrude Stein</a> also makes a cameo appearance in &#8220;The Myopia,&#8221; when a brief section from her lecture on the theater is quoted in the second act  &#151;  by Mr. Greenspan, in the guise of Carol Channing, natch. Mr. Greenspan also pays tribute to Stein, one of his aesthetic inspirations, by reading a lightly edited version of this lecture, titled &#8220;Plays,&#8221; as a hefty curtain raiser to weekend performances of &#8220;The Myopia.&#8221; (There is an ample two-hour break between shows.) </p><p>In Mr. Greenspan&#8217;s lilting delivery this dense display of Stein&#8217;s curious mixture of the obvious and the abstruse makes for delicious hearing. Adding just a touch of humor  by sardonic emphasis on a word here and there, he turns this long, logorrheic meditation on the differences among life, literature and the stage into an endearing bedtime story. You may get sleepy as Stein keeps circling back to reiterate the same ideas, but the perverse byways of her thought also feel strangely cozy and appealing. </p><p>&#8220;Is the thing seen or the thing heard the thing that makes most of its impression upon you at the theater,&#8221; Stein muses  in &#8220;Plays.&#8221; Mr. Greenspan makes a strong case for the thing heard in &#8220;The Myopia.&#8221; Although he accentuates the action with some fluid movements of his elegant limbs, mostly he simply sits still and unfurls the baroque text, setting the scenes with elaborate stage directions (&#8220;Light illuminates Warren G. Harding, immobile, seated in an easy chair in his room in the La Salle Hotel, Chicago, June 12, 1920&#8221;) and modulating his light, silken voice in various ways to portray dozens of characters. </p><p>I am not going to bother describing the plot. Mr. Greenspan shares with Stein a disdain for the strictures of logical narrative, and I am still not sure if that irritable orb, named Barclay, was the one writing the musical about Harding, or if it was his father, the fellow locked in the bathroom with the princess telephone. As the sourpuss Barclay himself puts it, &#8220;Oh how my dramaturgy is like my life. Both inscrutable.&#8221;</p><p>It&#8217;s the set pieces that stand out, like the wonderful scene in which Mr. Greenspan evokes the backstage machinations that led to the selection of Harding for the Republican presidential ticket in 1920.  The snarling back and forth among the party bigwigs is evoked with amusing potency. </p><p>Another highlight is the playful interaction between a character called the Orator and his Doppelg&#228;nger, who is basically Carol Channing. (This showbiz figure was chosen, I expect, because Mr. Greenspan does a terrific impersonation, although the text also makes reference to &#8220;Hello, Dolly!&#8221; along with the likes of Beckett and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130616234858/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/william_shakespeare/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about William Shakespeare.">Shakespeare</a> and Aristotle.) Between the Orator and his twin they manage to dispense with the second, third and fourth acts of the play we&#8217;re watching, roughly sketching out the details.</p><p>The blurry focus of &#8220;The Myopia&#8221; is entirely intentional, meant to draw our attention away from the superficial aspects of theater&#151;  the sets and costumes, the crisp stories, the meanings  &#151;  and orient it toward the larger purpose of this strange, magical ritual, which is simply to let our imaginations take flight from the mundane world and arrive where things unreal become real. </p><p>All that is required, as Mr. Greenspan makes abundantly clear, is a performer, a text and an audience. As he puts it, in a phrase Gertrude Stein would approve, &#8220;It&#8217;s telling how telling a telling can be.&#8221; </p><p><span class="bold">THE MYOPIA</span></p><p>Written and performed by David Greenspan; directed by Brian Mertes; lighting and design consultant, Peter Ksander; stage manager, Casey Llewellyn; produced by Maedhbh McCullagh; associate producer, Anna Hayman; graphic design by Anti/Anti.
